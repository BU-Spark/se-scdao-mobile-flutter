# SCDAO Fairfax County District Attorney's Office

Last semester, our team was working under the Suffolk County District Attorney’s Office to 
develop a cross-platform OCR and data entry app. However, due to structural changes at the Suffolk County District Attorney’s Office following the Biden Administration’s appointment of former District Attorney Rachel Rollins, our team has been shifted to working for the Fairfax County District Attorney’s Office as of the beginning of this semester. This application, now called ‘CourtInfo’, strives to achieve the same goals that the Suffolk County Office had. ‘CourtInfo’ is still a cross-platform OCR and data entry app intended to digitize several formats of paper forms that are used in cases that the office receives, making it easier for their office to search for these forms and allow them to perform district wide data analysis that could lead to a decrease in discrimination within Fairfax County’s judicial system. In terms of communications with the Fairfax County’s Office, we have been communicating to them through our points of contact at BU Spark!, namely our main adviser Ian Saucy. For the purposes of this project, Ian has been our customer.
